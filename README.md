1. ## Things to consider:
    1. Refer the **application.properties** file located at **src/main/resources/**
    2. Wherever **variable substitution** is available kindly provide an **appropriate variable**
    3. You'll need a database container as well, am using MySQL as my database
       1. The **image name** is **mysql**
       2. The **tag** is **8.0.26**
       3. Since its the database, hence we need to store all data generated by the container. The mysql container stores the data within the directory **/var/lib/mysql**, so, we need to **mount** this directory to a **persistent docker volume**.
       4. During the initialization phase, the container will execute files with extensions .sh, .sql and .sql.gz that are found in **/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d** directory. So, you need to mount the directory **database-files** in this repository to the **/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d** directory inside the container.
    4. Am using RabbitMQ as a message broker, so you'll have to spin a RabbitMQ container as well
       1. The **image name** is **rabbitmq**
       2. The **tag** is **3.9.2-management**
       3. Expose ports **5672** and **15672**
2. ## Output
    1. If you see the sign-up page at the following link then you have successfully setup all containers
        1. http://your-ip-address:8081/myapp/gateway/endpoint1
4. ## Tip
    1. All these 5 containers need to be on the same network
